    <div class="section-content">
      <p>
        I am a rising high school senior at Pine Crest School in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. I am passionate about using technology to make a difference in digital awareness and health-related advancements. Growing up as a first-generation American born to Hispanic immigrant parents has taught me the importance of perseverance, empathy, and community. My intellectual curiosity drives me to explore computational neurobiology and artificial intelligence, and I take pleasure in translating complex ideas into accessible learning experiences in both English and Spanish. I strive to create inclusive environments where every individual can build confidence in using technology to tell their own story and address real-world issues.
      </p>
      <p>
        Alongside my work in tech, I’m also a passionate vocalist with a deep love for musical theater, jazz, and classical performance. Whether I’m coding or singing, I find joy in connecting with others and bringing ideas to life.

          <p class="card-role"><strong>Founder &amp; President</strong></p>
          <p class="card-text">
            I founded Tech 4 Now, a youth-led 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization that bridges the generational digital divide by providing free technology education and resources in English and Spanish to children and seniors. I secured federal 501(c)(3) status, built the website, and to date, we have served over 200 kids and seniors across 6 countries and raised more than $2,000 in donations. I created the Kids Learn Tech program to teach coding (JavaScript, Python), internet safety, and digital literacy to kids ages 8–12, and later launched the Seniors Learn Tech program to bring the same curriculum to older adults. Both programs run in libraries, schools, and community centers across Florida and South America. I developed the curriculum, led outreach, recruited volunteers, and coordinated community partnerships. All programs offer verified community service hours.

          <p class="card-text">
            I work with Dr. Vanessa Aguiar-Pulido to analyze single-cell RNA-seq data (Scanpy/Python) for studying interneuron development across embryonic stages. Investigate cluster composition over time, identifying markers for radial glial cells (RGCs) and intermediate progenitor cells (IPCs) as well as potential endothelial and early neuronal populations. Perform clustering and differential expression analyses to compare wild-type versus knockout conditions, examining how genetic modifications influence neurodevelopment. Previously used R to explore overlaps between poison exons and minor intron genes, investigating their role in disorders such as Dravet Syndrome. Leverage computational tools to uncover molecular mechanisms underlying neurodevelopmental disorders.
