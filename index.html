      <p>
        Hi! I'm Jessica, a high school senior from South Florida. I'm passionate about using technology to make a difference in digital awareness and health-related advancements. Growing up as a first-generation American born to Hispanic immigrant parents has taught me the importance of perseverance, empathy, and community. My intellectual curiosity drives me to explore computational neurobiology and machine learning, and I take pleasure in translating complex ideas into accessible learning experiences in both English and Spanish. I strive to create inclusive environments where every individual can build confidence in using technology to tell their own story and address real-world issues.
      </p>
      <p>
        Alongside my work in tech, I’m also a passionate vocalist with a genuine love for musical theater, jazz, and classical performance. Whether I’m coding or singing, I find joy in connecting with others and bringing ideas to life.

          <p class="card-text">
            I founded Tech 4 Now, a youth-led 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization that bridges the generational digital divide by providing free technology education and resources in English and Spanish to children and seniors. I secured federal 501(c)(3) status, built the website, and to date, we have served 400+ kids and seniors across 6 countries and raised $5,000+ in donations. I created the Kids Learn Tech program to teach coding (JavaScript, Python), internet safety, and digital literacy to kids ages 8–12, and later launched the Seniors Learn Tech program to bring the same curriculum to older adults. Our programs are currently active in libraries, schools, and community centers in Florida, New York, and across Latin America. I developed the curriculum, led outreach, recruited volunteers, and coordinated community partnerships. All programs offer verified community service hours.

          <p class="card-role"><strong>Student Researcher</strong></p>
          <p class="card-text">
            I conduct research under Dr. Vanessa Aguiar-Pulido, leveraging computational tools to uncover molecular mechanisms underlying neurodevelopmental disorders. Currently, I'm analyzing single-cell RNA sequencing data from mouse models at three embryonic time points to study interneuron development and how genetic changes, like cD2 deletions, impact brain development. Using Python and the Scanpy framework, I perform preprocessing (quality control, normalization, and feature selection), dimensionality reduction (PCA, UMAP), and implement unsupervised machine learning methods (Leiden clustering) to identify cell populations and characterize shifts in cell-type composition. I also apply Scanorama for batch correction and use PAGA with Diffusion Pseudotime for pseudotime inference to map developmental trajectories across wild-type and knockout genotypes. Previously, I used R to explore overlaps between poison exons and minor intron genes, investigating their role in disorders such as Dravet Syndrome.
