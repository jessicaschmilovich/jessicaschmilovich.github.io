      <p>
        Hi! I'm Jessica, a high school senior from South Florida. I'm passionate about using technology to make a difference in digital awareness and health-related advancements. Growing up as a first-generation American born to Hispanic immigrant parents has taught me the importance of perseverance, empathy, and community. My intellectual curiosity drives me to explore computational neurobiology and machine learning, and I take pleasure in translating complex ideas into accessible learning experiences in both English and Spanish. I strive to create inclusive environments where every individual can build confidence in using technology to address real-world issues.
      </p>
      <p>
        Alongside my work in tech, I'm a dedicated vocalist with a genuine love for musical theater, jazz, and classical performance. Whether I'm coding or singing, I find joy in connecting with others and bringing ideas to life.

            I founded Tech 4 Now, a youth-led 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization that bridges the generational digital divide by providing free technology education and resources in English and Spanish to children and seniors. I secured federal 501(c)(3) status, built the website, and to date, we have served 600+ kids and seniors across 6 countries and raised $5,000+ in donations. I created the Kids Learn Tech program to teach coding (JavaScript, Python), internet safety, and digital literacy to kids ages 8–12, and launched the Seniors Learn Tech program to bring the same curriculum to older adults. Our programs are currently active in libraries, schools, and community centers in Florida, New York, and across Latin America. I developed the curriculum, led outreach, recruited volunteers, and coordinated community partnerships.

            I conduct computational neurobiology research under Dr. Vanessa Aguiar-Pulido, leveraging diverse computational approaches to understand neurodevelopmental disorders. Currently, I'm analyzing single-cell RNA sequencing data from mouse medial ganglionic eminence across three embryonic timepoints, investigating how cyclin D2 deletions affect interneuron development. Using Python/Scanpy, I implement machine learning methods including preprocessing, dimensionality reduction (PCA/UMAP), unsupervised clustering (Leiden), batch correction (Scanorama), and trajectory inference (PAGA with diffusion pseudotime) to map developmental trajectories. Previously, I used R to explore overlaps between poison exons and minor intron genes in disorders like Dravet Syndrome.
